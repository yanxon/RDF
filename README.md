# RDF ---> Density of States (DOS) at Fermi level.

A machine learning project to predict DOS of sp and spd systems. This project is based on this paper:


Descriptor:
Radial distribution function (RDF)

Prediction:
DOS at Fermi level

We made a RDF code and test the validity using several XCl (X = Li, Na, K) compounds.
